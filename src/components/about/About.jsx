          The Swift Coding Club was founded in 2022 with the goal of making
          coding accessible and fun for everyone. We believe that everyone
          should have the opportunity to learn how to code, regardless of their
          background or experience level. Our members come from all walks of
          life and range from students to professionals, but what they all share
          is a love of coding and a desire to learn more. Our team of
          experienced mentors and instructors provide support, guidance, and
          feedback to help our members reach their goals with an environment to
          experiment and create great tools using technologies relevant in
          todayâ€™s world. We also organize regular events and workshops, where
          members can network, collaborate, and share their work. Whether you're
          looking to build your portfolio, make new friends, or just have fun,
          the Swift Coding Club is the perfect place for you. The club was
          created with the goal of providing students with a community where
          they can learn and develop their skills in programming and app
          development. The club is open to students of all skill levels, from
          those who are just starting out to those who have been coding for
          years. The club was inaugurated and was made open to the students of
